snippets
========

I have decided to keep a snippets repo. Mostly as part of keeping track of small changes but also as source of info for users wishing to track edits I have made.

For those interested this is done using these apps

[sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org/) and [sublime text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).
